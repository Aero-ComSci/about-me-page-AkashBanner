        Artificial Intelligence has changed the way we look at the world as a whole, as well as changing overall jobs that people take for a living! Personally, my goal is to pursue a career as a cybersecurity agent and hack companies (with their permission) to help them improve their security. I am taking several coding classes and joining coding clubs at school to learn how to code in different languages, and due to the revolutionary changes in the world of Artificial Intelligence, I want to pursue a career in technology, and cybersecurity just is the right fit for me!

        I possess characteristics that range from being resilient, being a team player, and learning how to work through my problems, which will all be useful if I pursue a career in technology. By being resilient and working through my problems, I’ll be able to handle whatever is thrown on my plate and not give up before I solve the problems. By being a team player, I will be able to work with whoever I get assigned to work with, and be able to split up the amount of work equally and in a fair manner.

        Some of my major accomplishments from High School are making lots of great friends, as well as passing my advanced English test (which let me take Advanced English in my Freshman year of high school). I’ve participated in several clubs such as the Emerald Hack, the AI club, and the chess club at my high school. From my experiences in and outside of school, I have learned that I have a strong passion in working with computers and in technology in general. Additionally, I love working with teams & making my own creative/innovative projects due to them being fun, and getting to teach others/enlighten others about my own work!

        Some fun facts about me are: my favorite subject in school is Computer Science, I have an above average height, I love making new friends & socializing in general, and I love animals (specifically dogs & cats)! Also, you can contact me at akashbanerjee062009@gmail.com!
